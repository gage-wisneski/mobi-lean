      <p>Hi Mark,</p>
      <p>Just wanted to share that I hit 20 lbs of weight loss this weekend! I was — when I first started your program and am now at —! It’s kind of hard to believe…</p>
      <p>I started looking through photos and the change I saw blew me away. Weight can be one of those things that becomes so distorted in our minds that until you take the time to reflect, you may not realize how much you have changed.</p>
      <p>Thanks for prompting me to think about food in a different way. I delved into the paleo and primal movements over the past month and gained a vast amount of knowledge that expands upon and compliments your program.</p>
      <p>Keep me posted on when you are starting a challenge at Mobius! I still want to keep pushing and see where I can take my body and my health.</p>
      <p>Thanks again,</p>
      <p>Aimee</p>

      <p>I joined the 20 Day Fat Fat Loss in January to kickstart a revamp of my fitness lifestyle. I felt like I had a pretty good grasp on my workouts but definitely needed a wake up call for my eating habits. So when you explained the easy to follow plan I knew the 5lb goal was attainable in 20 days…..who knew I would lose over 11lbs!? I not only have more sustained energy throughout the day, but I am finally sleeping normally. Just this past weekend I started trying on all my clothes and even though I was frustrated that nothing seemed to fit the same anymore, I couldn’t help but be excited that I had slimmed down so much! Your regular motivation and “no fluff” approach to lifestyle changes were essential! Plus, the fact that I don’t restrict myself from things such as dairy and an occasional glass of red wine (and dark chocolate) make this diet more of a sustainable way of living. I have continued to drop weight and am currently down 14lbs! Cancun here I come! Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>
      <p>Feeling like a champion, ~Selena</p>
